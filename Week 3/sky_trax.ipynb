On one flight the representative at the gate showed me the cabin plan which indicated that the seats I had paid for had been resold to other passengers.  I emailed Qatar with a request for a refund. I have sent dozens of emails and have had only one response with my case number. The website says they will respond in 60 days. This period has elapsed long ago and still no response.

Boarding as for most flights I had over the past year via a remote stand from the feared bus gate C41. At first we were told that business would board last (the opposite of my last flight, when I was told that Qatar changed its policy and business class pax would get on the bus first). After half way of boarding, the gate agent decided to hold the economy class boarding and to do the business class boarding now. The boarding procedure via bus gate seems to be unorganized and chaotic. The first thing I was told by the purser on board was that my ordered meal wasn’t on board. I ordered it days before the flight, received a confirmation email and it was even printed on my boarding pass. I was told that the meal booking was in the system, but catering failed to load it. This is the 2nd time this happened to me, the last time for to the non functioning of the app meal booking, which I reported to customer services who decided to ignore my mails. If Qatar offers this service of pre booking meals in business class, they should honor it! The flight itself was uneventful and on time. WiFi did work.</div>\n",

            "✅ Trip Verified | Having flown Qatar previously I chose to book flights for our holiday to Thailand. I paid extra for seat allocation. On not one of the 3 flights were the seats I paid for allocated to me. The aircraft in each case had not been changed. On one flight the representative at the gate showed me the cabin plan which indicated that the seats I had paid for had been resold to other passengers.  I emailed Qatar with a request for a refund. I have sent dozens of emails and have had only one response with my case number. The website says they will respond in 60 days. This period has elapsed long ago and still no response. Customer service is extraordinarily poor. The flights were very poor, some of the worst service and food I have experienced on a long haul flight.\n",
            "Not Verified | It is always a pleasure to fly with Qatar Airways. I testimonied the professionalism, the dedication and the friendliness of the crew on both flights, and this makes the flight very pleasant. The seat is very comfortable and the individual space is large. Food and drinks are excellent. Fasten seat belt announcements appear on the screen, so your program on the screen is not interrupted and/or you do not wake up when you are sleeping. My experience is the best from all airlines I flew so far. I flew with my 11 year old son - treated with respect like an adult; some gadget toys for kids might be nice.\n",
            "✅ Trip Verified | I was not served the correct meal despite my request for western vegetarian on the flight segment from Singapore to Doha. I was shocked that they told me that their reservation record stated that I never requested a special meal request despite my booking itinerary showing that I have reserved a vegetarian meal for all segments. I assume that I was not served the right meal since they did not come back to clarify with me. No service recovery and terrible experience with no sense of accountability or whatsoever.\n",
            "✅ Trip Verified |  I am always amazed with Qatar Airways services. The airport, the lounge, the staff, all is excellent. The most important takeaway is it makes me feel secure and little risks. Food is good. Attendants are so friendly and professional. Kudos to great service.\r\n",
            "\n",
            "✅ Trip Verified |  Doha Al Safwa lounge offered great service and food and drinks. Boarding as for most flights I had over the past year via a remote stand from the feared bus gate C41. At first we were told that business would board last (the opposite of my last flight, when I was told that Qatar changed its policy and business class pax would get on the bus first). After half way of boarding, the gate agent decided to hold the economy class boarding and to do the business class boarding now. The boarding procedure via bus gate seems to be unorganized and chaotic. The first thing I was told by the purser on board was that my ordered meal wasn’t on board. I ordered it days before the flight, received a confirmation email and it was even printed on my boarding pass. I was told that the meal booking was in the system, but catering failed to load it. This is the 2nd time this happened to me, the last time for to the non functioning of the app meal booking, which I reported to customer services who decided to ignore my mails. If Qatar offers this service of pre booking meals in business class, they should honor it! The flight itself was uneventful and on time. WiFi did work.\n",
            "✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was fast and friendly. Qatar does not permit access to its Bangkok business class lounge to its Platinum members. The contract Miracle lounge does not deserve the name and is one of the worst at BKK airport. Boarding was well organized besides the large number of pax due to the aircraft size. I was lucky to have a seat on the upper deck, which is more quiet. Flight was smooth and uneventful on the magnificent A380. Food was decent, though nothing special. WIFI did not work throughout the flight. Flight arrived on time and disembarkation was fast.\n",
            "✅ Trip Verified | I had a disappointing experience with Qatar Airways on flight QR426. The flight was scheduled to depart at 2:50 PM, but it was delayed until 3:30 PM  This unnecessary delay disrupted my schedule significantly and made me feel that my time was not valued.\n",
            "✅ Trip Verified |  Experienced worst food service in QR763 from Doha to Montreal. 2 times, for brunch and snack, we were served last and couldn't get what was in their menu. But we got the same reply \"we are running out of food\". Raised a complaint, but received only generic replies and no solution. Please don't make promises that you are giving world's best dining when you are not able to provide the same food to all of your passengers.\n",
            "✅ Trip Verified |  I arrived from Warsaw to Doha 12:06 and the airplane door opened 12:10, the bus took so long to get us to a gate that we only arrived at 12:30 and I arrived my gate to Erbil at 12:40 but the 12.55 flight was left.  It took me until 1:45 with transfer desk to call gate supervisor just to give me another ticket. And he told me no hotel because my connection was 50 minutes and not 45 minutes. He told me to get back at 6 am to see weather I am eligible to accommodation, went back to transfer desk only to find the hotel is fully booked after 4:30.  I messaged Qatar airways and they said that they cant do anything for me as its airport related.\n",
            "✅ Trip Verified |  Seat 47H should not exist. Located almost at the rear where the aisle becomes narrower and narrower. Measured from the edge of seatback of 47F aisle seat to the edge of my seat 47H armrest = 20inches. 20 inches of aisle for pax and crew.

Boarding as for most flights I had over the past year via a remote stand from the feared bus gate C41. At first we were told that business would board last (the opposite of my last flight, when I was told that Qatar changed its policy and business class pax would get on the bus first). After half way of boarding, the gate agent decided to hold the economy class boarding and to do the business class boarding now. The boarding procedure via bus gate seems to be unorganized and chaotic. The first thing I was told by the purser on board was that my ordered meal wasn’t on board. I ordered it days before the flight, received a confirmation email and it was even printed on my boarding pass. I was told that the meal booking was in the system, but catering failed to load it. This is the 2nd time this happened to me, the last time for to the non functioning of the app meal booking, which I reported to customer services who decided to ignore my mails. If Qatar offers this service of pre booking meals in business class, they should honor it! The flight itself was uneventful and on time. WiFi did work.</div>\n",
